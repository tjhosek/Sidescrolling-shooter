# final-project
This game is a sidescrolling cover-based shooter I created as a final project for my. The player and enemies can duck behind pieces of cover to avoid damage. The most interesting implementations are the enemy AIs using state machines and an aiming system for interpreting crosshair position in the 2d space to an accurate intended target in the 3d space.
